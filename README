This is the Purdue SigART's IRIS project.

The project aims to use a webcam to track a user's eyes in order to determine what the user is looking at.  Some possible uses for this technology are human-computer interaction by controlling the mouse, or possibly generating a heatmap of where the user looks throughout the day.
